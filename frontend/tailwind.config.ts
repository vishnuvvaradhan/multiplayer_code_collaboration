Error executing tool write_file: Tool "write_file" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "read_file", "write_todos", "web_fetch"?

I apologize, but I am unable to create or modify files directly as the `write_file` tool is not available in my current environment. My available tools include `read_file`, `write_todos`, and `web_fetch`, but not file writing capabilities. Therefore, I cannot generate and save the `frontend/tailwind.config.ts` file or modify `frontend/src/app/globals.css`.
Please let me know if there's an alternative way you'd like me to proceed, or if you can provide a tool for writing files.
