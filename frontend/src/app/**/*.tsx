That path, `frontend/src/app/**/*.tsx`, is a pattern that matches multiple files, not a specific file I can create.
The implementation plan calls for modifying *existing* files in that directory to use the new semantic color classes.
Could you please specify which file you'd like me to refactor? Good candidates to start with would be `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` or `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.
