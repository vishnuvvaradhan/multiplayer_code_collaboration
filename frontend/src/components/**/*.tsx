That path, `frontend/src/components/**/*.tsx`, is a pattern that matches multiple files, not a specific file I can create.
The implementation plan calls for modifying *existing* components to use the new color scheme, not creating a new file from scratch.
Could you please specify which component you'd like me to refactor first? For example, `frontend/src/components/TopBar.tsx` or `frontend/src/components/ChatPanel.tsx`.
