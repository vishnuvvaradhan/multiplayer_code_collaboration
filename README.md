## Frontend

The frontend is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application with a modern UI for collaborative code editing.

### Getting Started with Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Frontend Features

- Real-time code collaboration UI
- Chat panel for team communication

## Backend

Backend implementation is planned and will handle:
- Real-time collaboration server
- WebSocket communication
- Code synchronization
- User authentication and session management

See `backend/README.md` for more details.

## Development

This is a monorepo structure with separate frontend and backend applications. Each can be developed and deployed independently.
